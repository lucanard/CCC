\title{Wrapper function to online querying of m/z candidates in metfRag and get CCC re-ranking}
\usage{
metfragging(tni, ps_spectra, threshold, markers, pre_filter)
}
\arguments{
\item{tni}{the reduced peakTable given by the CCC.peaktable or CCC.xsaFA functions}

\item{ps_spectra}{the pseudospectra given by the ps_spec function}

\item{threshold}{the threshold used to discard low intense MS/MS markers}

\item{markers}{a list of markers given from your own statistical analysis. If NULL, all the first most intense ion of each speudospectra are analyzed; WARNING = data file must be massive and it might lead to errors.}

\item{pre_filter}{if TRUE, it uses the features measured by the CCC method to pre-filter candidates before performing in-silico fragmentation. It speeds up the process, but it is error-prone. default is set to FALSE}
}
\value{
a list of data.frames containing the outcome of metfRag reordered according to the CCC method
}
\description{
The function handles MSe data to obtain MS/MS analysis through the metfRag package and to reorder the molecules according to the CCC method calculations. It directly queries the the 4 most intense ions of a pseudospectra in metfRag, discards imporbabloe structures according to some heuristic rules, then reranks the obtained candidates using the Y variables extrapolated in the reduced peakTable tni.
}
\examples{
data(peakTable)
tni <- CCC.peakTable(peakTable, polarity = "negative")
ps_spectra <- ps_spec(tni, peakTable)
results <- metfragging(tni, ps_spectra, markers = 3998)
