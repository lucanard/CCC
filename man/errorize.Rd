\description{The method is specific to generate error in a matrix with 9 columns as the X variables matrix generated by the dataset.building function. It is useful to observe the influence of the error in the training-test set testing.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
errorize(x, errori, i2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{x = the X variables matrix to generate error on. It must correspond to the X variables matrix given by the dataset.building function.
errori = a numeric vector containing the error values to be added to the correct values. The names of the errors must be "ppms", for mass error, "Cees" for Carbon estimation errors, and "nerr" for normal distributed error around the values of 10 ppms and 1 Cees.
i2 = a value to select the corresponding error in the errori vector. It is though to be used in iterative form using the "for" loops.
